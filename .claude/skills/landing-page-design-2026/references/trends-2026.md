# Modern Design Trends 2025-2026

## Core Philosophies
1. **Anticipatory UX**: The interface predicts what the user wants based on behavior or source, rather than just reacting.
2. **Kinetic Typography**: Text isn't just for reading; it's a structural and animated visual element.
3. **Eco-Consciousness**: Dark modes aren't just an aesthetic; they are "Energy-Saving Layers" for OLED screens.
4. **Strategic Maximalism**: Bold weights, overlapping elements, and high-contrast visuals that disrupt the typical "clean" SaaS look.

## Color Palettes
- **The Obsidian Night**: `#050505` background, `#22D3EE` (cyan) or `#F472B6` (pink) as neon accents.
- **Organic Earth**: Deep clay reds, moss greens, and stone grays with paper-like textures.
- **High-Contrast Digital**: Pure black and pure white with a single, searing highlight color.

## Interaction Principles
- **Weight & Inertia**: Animations should feel like they have physical weight.
- **Micro-feedback**: Every action has a visual/haptic reaction (e.g., a button "breathing" on hover).
- **Asymmetric Transitions**: Entrance and exit animations should not be mirror images; enter fast, exit slow (or vice-versa) to feel more natural.
